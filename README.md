## Overview

**gold-api-feed** is a Claude Code skill and MCP server that gives AI agents real-time precious metals and cryptocurrency prices with a full **multi-agent trading analysis framework** — inspired by [TradingAgents](https://github.com/rawbethwebsites/TradingAgents).

Deploy specialized analyst agents — Technical, Sentiment, Fundamental, and News — that debate market conditions and produce structured buy/sell/hold recommendations.

### Supported Assets

| Symbol | Asset | Type |
|--------|-------|------|
| XAU | Gold | Precious Metal |
| XAG | Silver | Precious Metal |
| XPT | Platinum | Precious Metal |
| XPD | Palladium | Precious Metal |
| BTC | Bitcoin | Cryptocurrency |
| ETH | Ethereum | Cryptocurrency |
| HG | Copper | Industrial Metal |

## Multi-Agent Framework

The skill mirrors the structure of a real trading firm — analyst teams debate, researchers challenge, and a portfolio manager enforces risk.

### Analyst Team
- **Technical Analyst** — EMA crossovers, RSI, MACD, support/resistance
- **Sentiment Analyst** — 24h momentum, volume analysis, market mood
- **Fundamental Analyst** — macro context, safe haven demand, dollar correlation
- **News Analyst** — macro events, central bank signals, geopolitical risk

### Researcher Team
- **Bullish Researcher** — builds the case for entry, stress-tests bull thesis
- **Bearish Researcher** — challenges assumptions, identifies traps and fakeouts
- Configurable debate rounds (1–5) for high/low conviction decisions

### Risk Management & Portfolio Manager
- Position sizing by account risk %
- Value at Risk (VaR 95%) calculation
- Volatility regime detection (Low / Normal / High / Extreme)
- Order approval/rejection with margin checks
- Max daily drawdown enforcement

---

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9+
- `requests` and `aiohttp`

```bash
pip install requests aiohttp
```

No API key required — data from [gold-api.com](https://gold-api.com) (free, no auth).

## Claude Code Installation

### Method 1: Clone & Copy (Recommended)

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/rawbethwebsites/gold-api-feed.git
cd gold-api-feed

# Copy skill to Claude Code skills directory
cp -r . ~/.claude/skills/gold-api-feed/
```

Restart Claude Code — the skill activates automatically when you ask about:
- Gold, silver, bitcoin, or ethereum prices
- Trade entries, stop losses, position sizing
- Market analysis or buy/sell decisions

### Method 2: Manual Install

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills/gold-api-feed
curl -L https://github.com/rawbethwebsites/gold-api-feed/archive/refs/heads/main.zip -o gold-api-feed.zip
unzip gold-api-feed.zip -d ~/.claude/skills/
mv ~/.claude/skills/gold-api-feed-main ~/.claude/skills/gold-api-feed
```

### Trigger Phrases

The skill activates on:
```
"What's gold at?"
"Should I buy XAU at $4,640?"
"Run a multi-agent analysis on Bitcoin"
"Show me precious metals prices"
"Calculate position size for gold trade"
"Bull vs bear debate on XAU"
```

---

## OpenClaw Installation

### Step 1: Clone into OpenClaw workspace

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rawbethwebsites/gold-api-feed.git \
  ~/.openclaw/workspace/skills/gold-api-feed
```

### Step 2: Register the skill

Add to your OpenClaw skills registry (`~/.openclaw/workspace/skills-registry.json`):

```json
{
  "id": "gold-api-feed",
  "name": "Gold API Feed",
  "category": "Trading & Finance",
  "status": "active",
  "path": "~/.openclaw/workspace/skills/gold-api-feed",
  "entrypoint": "scripts/mcp_server.py",
  "triggerPhrases": [
    "check gold price",
    "analyze trade setup",
    "run market debate",
    "portfolio risk check"
  ]
}
```

### Step 3: Start the MCP server

```bash
python ~/.openclaw/workspace/skills/gold-api-feed/scripts/mcp_server.py
```

### Step 4: Connect via OpenClaw bridge

```python
from scripts.openclaw_bridge import OpenClawBridge

bridge = OpenClawBridge()

# Get live gold price
price = bridge.get_price("XAU")

# Run multi-agent analysis
analysis = bridge.market_analysis(
    asset="XAU",
    current_price=4640,
    support=[4620, 4600],
    resistance=[4680, 4700]
)

# Run 3-round bull/bear debate
debate = bridge.run_debate(asset="XAU", current_price=4640, rounds=3)
```

### Nova Integration

Nova calls the tool autonomously from cron jobs:

```bash
# Price check
python ~/.openclaw/workspace/skills/gold-api-feed/scripts/claude_code_tool.py

# Trade analysis
python -c "
from scripts.openclaw_bridge import OpenClawBridge
b = OpenClawBridge()
print(b.market_analysis('XAU', 4640, [4620], [4680]))
"
```
